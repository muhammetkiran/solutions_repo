A satellite, planet, or any celestial body orbiting another massive object follows a predictable path, determined by the balance between gravitational attraction and the object's inertia. Two key parameters define an orbit: Orbital Radius ( \\(r\\) ) : The distance from the center of the central mass (e.g., the Earth or the Sun) to the orbiting object. Orbital Period ( \\(T\\) ) : The time required for the object to complete one full revolution around the central body. For a stable orbit, the gravitational force must act as the centripetal force that keeps the object in circular motion. Theory The gravitational force between two masses \\(M\\) (central body) and \\(m\\) (orbiting body) is given by Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation: \\(F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\) For an object in a circular orbit, the required centripetal force is: \\(F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Since gravity provides the necessary centripetal force, we set these two forces equal to each other: \\(\\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Canceling \\(m\\) and solving for orbital velocity \\(v\\) : \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) Since orbital period \\(T\\) is the time taken to complete one full orbit, we use the relationship between velocity, circumference, and time: \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v}\\) Substituting \\(v\\) : \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}\\) Key Observations: The orbital period increases with the cube root of the orbital radius. This is a direct consequence of Kepler\u2019s Third Law , which states: \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) The larger the central mass \\(M\\) , the stronger the gravitational pull, leading to shorter orbital periods for a given radius. Satellites closer to the Earth orbit faster than those farther away, explaining why the International Space Station (ISS) orbits in about 90 minutes , while the Moon takes 27.3 days . Example Problem Problem Statement: A satellite is launched into a circular orbit 500 km above Earth's surface . Determine its orbital period. Given Data: Mass of Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg Radius of Earth: \\(R_E = 6.371 \\times 10^6\\) m Altitude of the satellite: \\(h = 500 \\times 10^3\\) m Gravitational constant: \\(G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}\\) Nm\u00b2/kg\u00b2 Step 1: Calculate Orbital Radius The orbital radius is the sum of Earth\u2019s radius and the satellite\u2019s altitude: \\(r = R_E + h = (6.371 \\times 10^6) + (500 \\times 10^3)\\) \\(r = 6.871 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m}\\) Step 2: Apply the Orbital Period Formula \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}\\) Substituting values: \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{(6.871 \\times 10^6)^3}{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11}) (5.972 \\times 10^{24})}}\\) \\(T \\approx 5674 \\text{ s} \\approx 94.6 \\text{ min}\\) Step 3: Interpretation The satellite completes one orbit in approximately 94.6 minutes . This means an observer on Earth would see the satellite pass overhead multiple times per day. Lower-altitude satellites orbit faster due to stronger gravitational pull, while higher-altitude satellites (e.g., geostationary satellites at 35,786 km ) have much longer periods, often 24 hours . Applications and Real-World Importance 1. Satellites and Space Missions The orbital period determines how often communication satellites pass over a given location. Geostationary satellites are positioned at a specific orbital radius so that their period matches Earth\u2019s rotation (24 hours), keeping them fixed relative to the ground. 2. Planetary Orbits Kepler\u2019s Laws allow astronomers to determine the distances and periods of planets in our Solar System. For example, Earth\u2019s orbital radius around the Sun is 1 AU \\((1.496 \\times 10^{11}\\) m), giving it a 365.25-day period . 3. Space Travel and Orbital Transfers Understanding orbital mechanics is crucial for launching satellites, planning space missions, and docking with the ISS. The Hohmann Transfer Orbit method is used to move satellites between different orbits using minimal fuel. Conclusion The relationship between orbital period and radius is fundamental in astrophysics and engineering. The \\(T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{r^3/GM}\\) equation helps predict how celestial bodies and artificial satellites move in space.

Two key parameters define an orbit: Orbital Radius ( \\(r\\) ) : The distance from the center of the central mass (e.g., the Earth or the Sun) to the orbiting object. Orbital Period ( \\(T\\) ) : The time required for the object to complete one full revolution around the central body.
