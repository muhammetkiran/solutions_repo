## Algorithm Description

The goal is to compute the equivalent resistance between two nodes (source and sink) in a circuit modeled as an undirected graph, where:

- **Nodes**: Represent circuit junctions.
- **Edges**: Represent resistors, with weights as resistance values (in ohms).

The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph by reducing series and parallel resistor configurations until only the source and sink nodes remain, connected by a single edge whose weight is the equivalent resistance.

### Steps:
1. **Series Connections**:
   - Identify a node with degree 2, connected to two resistors.
   - Replace with a single resistor:$$ R_{\text{series}} = R_1 + R_2$$.
   - Remove the node, connect its neighbors with the new resistance.

2. **Parallel Connections**:
   - Identify multiple edges between two nodes.
   - Replace with one edge:$$ R_{\text{parallel}} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$, or$$ \frac{1}{R_{\text{parallel}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$$.
   - Update the graph with the new edge.

3. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat series and parallel reductions until only the source and sink remain.
   - Nested structures are handled iteratively, reducing inner patterns first.

4. **Termination**:
   - Stop when the graph has two nodes connected by one edge, its weight being the equivalent resistance.
   - Assumes series-parallel reducible circuits; otherwise, additional methods (e.g., delta-wye) are needed.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
Function CalculateEquivalentResistance(Graph G, Node source, Node sink):
    While G has > 2 nodes OR (2 nodes with source, sink connected):
        // Series reduction
        For node n in G:
            If degree(n) == 2:
                Neighbors n1, n2; R1 = edge(n1, n); R2 = edge(n, n2)
                R_series = R1 + R2
                Remove n
                If n1 != n2:
                    Add edge(n1, n2, R_series)
                Continue

        // Parallel reduction
        For nodes u, v in G:
            If multiple edges between u, v:
                R_i = resistances of edges
                Conductance = sum(1/R_i)
                R_parallel = 1 / Conductance
                Remove edges(u, v)
                Add edge(u, v, R_parallel)
                Continue

        Break // No reductions possible

    If edge(source, sink) exists:
        Return edge weight
    Return infinity // No path
```

### Explanation

- **Series**: A degree-2 node (n1–R1–n–R2–n2) is reduced to n1–(R1 + R2)–n2, removing n.
- **Parallel**: Multiple edges between nodes are combined using conductance:$$ \frac{1}{R_{\text{parallel}}} = \sum \frac{1}{R_i}$$.
- **Nested Handling**: Iterative reductions simplify inner structures first, with DFS aiding pattern detection.
- **Edge Cases**: Avoids self-loops and ensures a valid path exists.

### Example Applications

#### Example 1: Series Combination
- **Circuit**: 2Ω and 3Ω in series between A and B via C.
- **Graph**: A --(2Ω)--> C --(3Ω)--> B
- **Steps**:
  1. C has degree 2. Series:$$ 2 + 3 = 5Ω$$.
  2. Remove C, add A --(5Ω)--> B.
- **Output**: 5Ω
- **Verification**:
  - Current at 1V:$$I = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2A$$.
  - Voltage drops:$$ V_1 = 0.2 \cdot 2 = 0.4V$$,$$ V_2 = 0.2 \cdot 3 = 0.6V$$, total$$ 0.4 + 0.6 = 1V$$.



### Efficiency and Improvements

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Series: O(V) to find degree-2 nodes.
  - Parallel: O(E) for multi-edges, up to O(V²) in dense graphs.
  - Iterations: Up to O(V).
  - Total: O(V²) to O(V³).
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for adjacency lists.
- **Improvements**:
  - Use priority queues for degree-2 nodes or multi-edges.
  - Apply DFS to prioritize inner reductions.
  - Add delta-wye for non-series-parallel circuits.
  - Optimize with NetworkX for graph operations.
  - Use high-precision arithmetic for small resistances.
