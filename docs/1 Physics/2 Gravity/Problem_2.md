## **Motivation**

Escape velocity represents the minimum speed an object must attain to break free from a celestial body's gravitational pull without further propulsion. This idea scales up through the concept of **cosmic velocities**, which are key to understanding artificial satellites, interplanetary travel, and potentially interstellar missions. These velocities — first, second, and third cosmic velocities — set the benchmarks for different gravitational boundaries.

## **1. Definitions**

### **First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)**

* The minimum speed needed to enter a stable circular orbit just above a celestial body's surface.
* Formula:

  $$
  v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
  $$

  Where:

  * $G$: gravitational constant,
  * $M$: mass of the celestial body,
  * $R$: radius of the celestial body.

### **Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)**

* The minimum speed needed to escape a celestial body's gravitational field without propulsion.
* Formula:

  $$
  v_2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
  $$

### **Third Cosmic Velocity**

* The speed needed to escape the gravitational field of the entire star system (e.g., the Solar System).
* Depends on the Sun's mass and the distance from the Sun at launch (e.g., Earth's orbit).
* Formula:

  $$
  v_3 = \sqrt{v_{\text{escape, sun}}^2 + v_{\text{orbital}}^2}
  $$

## **2. Mathematical Analysis**

* **Variables affecting velocities:**

  * Mass $M$ of the celestial body
  * Radius $R$
  * Gravitational constant $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}\cdot\text{s}^2$
* **Assumptions:**

  * No atmospheric drag
  * No rotational effects

## **4. Importance in Space Exploration**

* **First Cosmic Velocity**: Used for satellite launches and orbital space stations (e.g., ISS).
* **Second Cosmic Velocity**: Required for missions leaving a planet (e.g., Moon missions).
* **Third Cosmic Velocity**: Necessary for escaping the solar system (e.g., Voyager probes).

## **5. Conclusion**

Understanding and calculating cosmic velocities is essential in mission planning, spacecraft design, and predicting the energy requirements for various goals in space exploration — from placing satellites into orbit to sending probes across interstellar distances.
